TL;DR You can find all the required labor law posters for
all states for 2022-05-21 in the GitHub releases on the side.

Labor law posters are required to be sent to your employees.
With remote workers and a limited budget, this single file
scraper is inefficient but gets the job done (should've used asyncio
after all...) by grabbing all states' necessary labor law posters.
